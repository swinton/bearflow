> An [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow for working with [Bear](https://bear.app)

## Installation

1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/swinton/bearflow/releases/latest/download/Bearflow.alfredworkflow)
1. Open the downloaded file, `Bearflow.alfredworkflow`, directly to install

Alternatively, via the command-line:

```shell
curl --remote-name https://github.com/swinton/bearflow/releases/latest/download/Bearflow.alfredworkflow
open Bearflow.alfredworkflow
```

## Usage

The workflow exposes a `note` keyword to create a new note in Bear. The new note will be [tagged](https://blog.bear.app/2017/08/bear-tips-organize-notes-with-tags-and-infinite-nested-tags/) automatically with the current date, in `#year/month/day` format, which makes it easy to see what notes were taken for each day.
